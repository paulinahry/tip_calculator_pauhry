Mach√©rie is an accident antique inspired by the dynamics of old-style fonts. 
Wide signs with high contrast are supported by smooth transitions to sharp serifs. 
The font works well in a set of large inscriptions, identity and any accident, 
but still good in a small size. 
Also the font has an extended latin and extended cyrillic so you can use it 
in many languages.
